1) Produce a timestamp for 1 a.m. on the 31st of August 2012.![image](/images/day3-images/timestamp/img.png)
2) Find the result of subtracting the timestamp '2012-07-30 01:00:00' from the timestamp '2012-08-31 01:00:00'![image](/images/day3-images/timestamp/img_1.png)
3) Produce a list of all the dates in October 2012. They can be output as a timestamp (with time set to midnight) or a date.![image](/images/day3-images/timestamp/img_2.png)
4) Get the day of the month from the timestamp '2012-08-31' as an integer.![image](/images/day3-images/timestamp/img_3.png)
5) Work out the number of seconds between the timestamps '2012-08-31 01:00:00' and '2012-09-02 00:00:00'![image](/images/day3-images/timestamp/img_4.png)
6) For each month of the year in 2012, output the number of days in that month. Format the output as an integer column containing the month of the year, and a second column containing an interval data type.![image](/images/day3-images/timestamp/img_5.png)
7) For any given timestamp, work out the number of days remaining in the month. The current day should count as a whole day, regardless of the time. Use '2012-02-11 01:00:00' as an example timestamp for the purposes of making the answer. Format the output as a single interval value.![image](/images/day3-images/timestamp/img_6.png)
8) Return a list of the start and end time of the last 10 bookings (ordered by the time at which they end, followed by the time at which they start) in the system.![image](/images/day3-images/timestamp/img_7.png)
9) Return a count of bookings for each month, sorted by month![image](/images/day3-images/timestamp/img_8.png)
10) Work out the utilisation percentage for each facility by month, sorted by name and month, rounded to 1 decimal place. Opening time is 8am, closing time is 8.30pm. You can treat every month as a full month, regardless of if there were some dates the club was not open.![image](/images/day3-images/timestamp)
